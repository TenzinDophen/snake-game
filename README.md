# snake-game
# This is the basic part of the game, much more improvement could be done. 
# The snake game has a snake and an apple. The snake has a head and a tail in the beginning. The snake can eat the apple on the way, ifb   # both clashes. If that happens, the user gets a score in multiple of 5 displayed in the terminal. Additionally, a tail gets added to the # body too. The snake game ends if it touches the boundaries or the head touches one of its tail that are constructed after eating the     # apple. Every time works fine as it is. 
# The user uses the arrow keys on the keyboards to move the snake up, down , left or right. 

# Improvements :- apples could be generated close to the boundary
#               avoiding code redendancy and splitting the codes in classes and functions
#               __init__ shouldnot have the makeTail call.
